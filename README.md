# Code-Magician

Low-code full-stack website builder focused on backend robustness and component-level editing.

## Overview

Code-Magician is an AI-powered website builder that prioritizes backend infrastructure over visual gimmicks. Unlike typical website builders that focus on front-end aesthetics, Code-Magician emphasizes building robust, functional backends with proper data models, API endpoints, and business logic.

## Key Features

### Component-Level Editing
- Edit individual components without regenerating entire pages
- Maintain context and state across component updates
- Iterative refinement of specific UI elements

### Backend-First Architecture
- Automated generation of database schemas
- RESTful API endpoint creation
- Business logic implementation
- Proper error handling and validation

### AI-Powered Generation
- Natural language to code translation using Langflow
- Image-based prompt support for visual mockups
- Intelligent component suggestions based on requirements

## Differentiator

Most AI website builders focus on generating visually appealing frontends but produce fragile backends. Code-Magician inverts this priority:

- **Traditional AI Builders**: Beautiful UI → Fragile backend
- **Code-Magician**: Robust backend → Clean, functional UI

## Technical Stack

- **AI Framework**: Langflow for orchestration
- **Languages**: JavaScript, Python
- **Focus Areas**: Backend architecture, API design, data modeling

## Project Status

Early-stage development. Core architecture designed, implementation in progress.

## Planned Features

- Multi-framework support (React, Vue, etc.)
- Database migration management
- Automated testing generation
- Deployment pipeline integration

## Use Cases

- Rapid MVP development for technical founders
- Backend scaffolding for full-stack applications
- Learning tool for understanding backend architecture

## Installation
```bash
